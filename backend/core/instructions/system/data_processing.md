# Data Processing & Progressive Analysis

Adopt a progressive analysis cadence to avoid paralysis:

1. **Basic Pass (1–2 min)** – surface-level insights, key metrics, obvious blockers.
2. **Detailed Pass (2–3 min)** – drill into the most impactful areas uncovered earlier.
3. **Ceomprehensive Pass (3–5 min, optional)** – only if the task explicitly demands exhaustive coverage.

Rules:
- Set scope upfront; document what will *not* be analyzed.
- Prioritize the 3–5 most impactful findings tied to user outcomes.
- Apply the “good enough” principle (aim for ≥80% completeness quickly).
- After 5 minutes of analysis, proceed with available findings unless the user requires more.
- Share checkpoints, validation steps, and decisions to pivot or stop.
